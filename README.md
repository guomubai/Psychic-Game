# Word Guess Game - (Hangman)

So, here is some basic pseudocode for the game

* First the player will press a key to start the game
* Then, the computer will randomly choose a word from a predefined list
* On the screen will be the "_" that indicates the missing letters of the workd
* We will also keep track of the letters guessed
* The player will guess letter (onkeyup)
      If the player enters a letter  that is correct
          The letter will appear in the lines
      If the player guesses incorrectly
          The letter will appear in the guessed letters array
* the gameboard will keep track of the letters guessed
* The player wins the game when they guess the word
* The player looses when they guess incorrectly 10 times


Oh, and we will have a nicktoons theme :)
